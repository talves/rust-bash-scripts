## Rust Cargo Bash Scripts

> This experimental RFC adds unstable support for single-file packages in cargo. ((rfc 3424)[https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3424-cargo-script.html])

Putting some examples of `cargo scripts` to test the ability to have a single file script.

### Use case

I was using a rust project to create a static site using leptos, but needed a way to globally install a cargo crate (trunk) prior to using the command in creating a build. I've included the install script here with others.
